INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s500e' is a WebPack part.
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_FCLK/clkgen/clkgen/obuf" (output signal=FCLK) has a
   mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I0 of SRAM_WE_X1
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:249 - The following adjacent carry multiplexers occupy different
   slice components.  The resulting carry chain will have suboptimal timing.
   	iocon/cnt1kHz/Mcompar_CNT_OUT_cmp_ge0000_cy<6>
   	iocon/cnt1kHz/Mcount_cntwait_cy<0>
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator core/EXEADDR_or00012 failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer core/EXMASK<2>14_SW0_f5.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,499 out of   9,312   16%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,908 out of   9,312   41%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,406 out of   4,656   51%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,406 out of   2,406 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,406   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,267 out of   9,312   45%
    Number used as logic:             3,908
    Number used as a route-thru:        359

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 56 out of      66   84%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      45
  Number of RAMB16s:                      7 out of      20   35%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.59

Peak Memory Usage:  198 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  5 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   5 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
